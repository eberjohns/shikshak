## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to convey knowledge and professionalism, inspired by the traditional robes of educators.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), close in hue to the primary color but heavily desaturated for a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), an analogous color that stands out against the indigo and light gray to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent different topics and functionalities, maintaining a clean and consistent aesthetic.
- Maintain a clear, hierarchical layout with ample whitespace to improve readability and focus on the content.
